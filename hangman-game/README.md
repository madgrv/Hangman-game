# Hangman Game

## Description

Hangman is a classic word guessing game. This React-based application allows users to play Hangman directly from their web browser. Players try to guess a hidden word by suggesting letters within a certain number of attempts. Each incorrect guess adds a part to the hangman drawing, and the game continues until the word is guessed correctly or the hangman drawing is complete.

- **Hangman Image**: Updated hangman drawing with each incorrect guess.
- **Attempt Counter**: Displays the number of remaining attempts.
- **New Game Button**: Resets the game and generates a new word to guess.
